# pfs
### A distributed file system for a dockerized world.

Pfs is a distributed file system built specifically for the Docker
ecosystem. You [deploy it with Docker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/pachyderm/pfs/),
just like other applications in your stack. Furthermore,
MapReduce jobs are specified as Docker containers, rather than .jars,
letting you perform distributed computation using any tools you want.
